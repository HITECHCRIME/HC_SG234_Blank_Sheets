## Lyrics

```
Blank sheets, don't ya wrap em up (yet)
Blank sheets, don't ya figure we (should hide em)
We surrounded and got some corpses to be laid down
We so sure they gon go underground

Bodies on my mind
Lay em down lay em down
Make them tight, cut and slice em up
So they fit compact, second round 
(on the floor on the floor)
No blood can spill, traces will be found
it's fact, all we going for right now will be gone,

Blank sheets are just waiting
For a causual acquaintance
Pass hits are too factual
for the me to care about the fainting

Blank sheets, don't ya wrap em up (yet)
Blank sheets, don't ya figure we (should hide em)
We surrounded and got some corpses to be laid down
We so sure they gon go underground

Acog on em, and I turn em to a calico bedrock, 
body fallin faster than a domino red bone 
shawty got her listening to redstar/
Death Star Shawty Tried to kill me now she gotta go/

one rhyme and fold them two rhyme three rhyme
one rhyme calling c a b s two rhyme three rhyme
one rhyme it's like christening to four rhyme
four rhyme one rhyme got the two rhyme it is time to three rhyme

Blank sheets, don't ya wrap em up (yet)
Blank sheets, don't ya figure we (should hide em)
We surrounded and got some corpses to be laid down
We so sure they gon go underground
