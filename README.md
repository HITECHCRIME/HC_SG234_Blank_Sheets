## Lyrics

```
Bodies on my mind
Lay em down lay em down
Make them tight, cut and slice em up
So they fit compact

Blank sheets are just waiting
For a causual acquaintance
Pass hits are too factual
for the me to care about the fainting

Blank sheets, don't ya wrap em up yet
Blank sheets, don't ya figure we should hide em
We surrounded and got some corpses to be laid down
We so sure it's gonna go underground

```
